== Description ==

This is some sample code to implement the [WooCommerce Software License Manager](https://github.com/maddisondesigns/woocommerce-software-license-manager) into your theme or plugin. The WooCommerces Software License Manager plugin provides seamless integration between WooCommerce and the [Software License Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/software-license-manager/) plugin.

When added to your Theme or plugin, this sample code will create an Activation Settings page (under the WordPress Settings Menu) that allows your clients to enter in their License Key. This key is then validated and activated against your Software License Manager plugin.
